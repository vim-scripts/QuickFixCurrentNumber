DESCRIPTION
You can navigate through the errors in the quickfix list with the built-in
:cfirst, :cnext, etc. commands. The quickfix and location lists have a
notion of "current item" (the highlighted one), and you can easily jump back
to it or others. But there's no built-in way to find out which error is at or
after the current cursor position, and you cannot limit the navigation to
errors in the current buffer.

This plugin provides additional quickfix commands like :Cnr and :Cgo to
print / go to the item at or after the cursor position, and motions like ]q
to go to previous / next errors in the current buffer, based on the cursor
position.

USAGE
:Cnr, :Lnr              Print the number of the item in the quickfix /
                        location list for the current cursor position (or the
                        next item after the cursor).

:Cgo, :Lgo, g<C-Q>      Go to the item in the quickfix / location list for the
                        current cursor position (or the next item after the
                        cursor).

[q / ]q                 Go to [count] previous / next start of an error in the
                        current buffer.
g[q / g]q               Go to [count] first / last error in the current
                        buffer.

[l / ]l                 Go to [count] previous / next start of a location list
                        item in the current buffer.
g[l / g]l               Go to [count] first / last location list item in the
                        current buffer.
